This repo contains my solutions to AI university course tasks.

For each task sheet ("pracownia", directories p1, p2 etc.) there is a validator script `validator.py`. It expects input/output files. You can create them by invoking script `create_io_files.sh`.

Solutions are validated like that: `python validator.py zad4 python zad4.py`
